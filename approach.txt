we have a list of passwords :


shoaib123
SHOAIB0004
Shaoib*00andOthers
TheLoveOfHer
1234456773232


now how do we tell jokes ? show hints ?

even if shoaib123 doesn't tell something but the category `Beautiful Name` tells a lot write

so all we need to do is first categorize the passwords:


Categories:
  
  name
  numbers
  number+words
  OnlyWords
  Usernameofcomputer
  ColorName
  AnimalName
  SongName
  Lyric


we will check :
    
    CamelCase
    if_half_number
    how many special marks
    is it a question       --> [is,what,when,how,?]
    is it a hard one       --> [just check how strong ]
    its all numers         --> [if contains all numbers]
    too mathmatics         --> [if equitions found]
    is color/aninal/food   --> [bruteforce in direcotry of animal list]
    is anime related       --> ["check weeb words"]
    is scientific          --> [scientific words]
    too many `n`           --> [if any alphabet repeat so often]


after categorizing we will search in a dedicated dictionary for that category
